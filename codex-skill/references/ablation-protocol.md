# Ablation Protocol

Use this protocol for `general` skills selected by the ablation plan.

## Goal

Measure whether the skill changes outcomes in a meaningful way.

High consistency between skill-on and skill-off runs means the skill adds little value.

## Cost-Efficient Triage

Generate a plan before running replay:

```bash
python scripts/skill_usefulness_audit.py audit \
  --skills-root ./skills \
  --usage-file ./usage.json \
  --json-out ./skill-audit-report.json \
  --ablation-plan-out ./skill-ablation-plan.json
```

The plan uses local evidence first:

- final score
- overlap
- quality burden
- activation volume
- evidence confidence
- missing or weak prior ablation

It then estimates model cost against a 10-case full protocol and writes an early-stop plan.

## Sampling

Start with `3` historical tasks per candidate skill.
Choose tasks where the skill should plausibly matter.
Prefer real user turns over synthetic prompts.
Expand to `5` cases when the first batch is mixed.
Expand to `10` cases only for high-impact or deletion-boundary decisions.

## Replay Method

For each selected case, run two isolated replays:

1. `with_skill`
2. `without_skill`

Keep these constant:

- same prompt
- same files and artifacts
- same model class when possible
- same tool permissions
- same success criteria

Use a fresh thread or isolated run if the host supports it.
Subagents are optional. They improve isolation and parallelism, but they increase total model spend when every branch runs full replay.

## Judge Method

Use pairwise comparison when judging open-ended outputs:

1. Compare `with_skill` and `without_skill` side by side.
2. Randomize A/B order.
3. Spot-check reversed order on boundary cases.
4. Prefer `pass/fail`, `same/better/worse`, and short reasons over long open-ended grading.

## Case Judgment

Record:

- `pass`: whether the run solved the task
- `score`: optional `0.0-1.0` quality score
- `tool_cost`: optional rough measure of tool calls, latency, or retries
- `verdict`: `better`, `same`, or `worse`
- `notes`: one short reason

## Normalized JSON Example

```json
[
  {
    "skill": "emotion-orchestrator",
    "case_id": "case-001",
    "with_skill": {"pass": true, "score": 0.92},
    "without_skill": {"pass": true, "score": 0.81},
    "verdict": "better",
    "notes": "with-skill run adapted reply style and avoided a follow-up correction"
  },
  {
    "skill": "tone-polisher",
    "case_id": "case-002",
    "with_skill": {"pass": true, "score": 0.84},
    "without_skill": {"pass": true, "score": 0.83},
    "verdict": "same",
    "notes": "final answer stayed materially equivalent"
  }
]
```

## Judgment Rule

Use `same` when the final answer, correctness, and workflow remain materially equivalent.
Use `better` when the skill improves correctness, speed, structure, or user-fit in a way the baseline did not.
Use `worse` when the skill adds friction, drift, or errors.

## Early Stop Rules

- Stop as low-value when `3/3` cases are `same` and `better_rate` is `0`.
- Stop as useful when at least `2/3` cases are `better` and no case is `worse`.
- Expand to `5` when the first batch is mixed.
- Expand to `10` only for delete-boundary or high-impact decisions.

## Model Cost

The audit script does not call an LLM during planning.
The plan estimates replay cost with three profiles:

- `light`: about `6.2k` model-cost units per case
- `realistic`: about `24k` model-cost units per case
- `coding`: about `50k` model-cost units per case

Each case assumes two replays plus one compact pairwise judge.

## Reporting

Feed the normalized ablation file into:

```bash
python scripts/skill_usefulness_audit.py audit --ablation-file ./ablation.json
```
